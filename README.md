### About The Design
This design is inspired by the Asirem theme. I reached this design by making a few changes on the default theme of Flarum. I want to share it with you, thinking you will like it.

The parts I edited;
- I made the dropdown menus with a smoother design.
- I adapted the Afrux widget plugin to this design.
- I organized the discussion page.
- I edited the profile page.
- I removed the sidebar of the blog page, so it became a full blog page.
- I organized the design of the tags page.
- If you add a poll to your discussion, you can see that it has also been edited.
- I added a customized scroll bar.
- I softened the corners of iframe plugins.

### Installation
All you need to do is copy and paste the `tavtie-simple-1.css` code into the Custom Css section on the admin/appearance page.
